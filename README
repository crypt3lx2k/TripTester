TripTester is an MIT licensed tripcode tester that works on mostly POSIX compliant systems.
TripTester's goal is to be compliant with 4chan, this includes corner cases like HTML entities and SJIS translation.

Compile with
$ ./configure && make && make install

If you want to install at a specific location then you utilize the --prefix with configure
$ ./configure --prefix=my/special/location && make && make install

For the configure script to work properly you need to have pkg-config installed.
The pkg-config program is used to locate the libraries and header files for OpenSSL.

On Ubuntu you may install the OpenSSL development files by installing the package libssl-dev.
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

On Fedora you may install the OpenSSL development files by installing the package openssl-devel.
$ su -c 'yum install openssl-devel'

After installing you may invoke the program with

$ trip

Usage examples:

trip will check the command line arguments for tripcodes to run, if there are no arguments it will prompt the user for input.

$ trip
>>> a  
!ZnBI2EKkq.
>>> tea 
!WokonZwxw2
>>> trip
!hEpdoZ.tHU
>>> 

You exit the program in this mode with C(trl)-d.
You may also pass tripcodes on the command line,

$ trip a tea trip
#a => !ZnBI2EKkq.
#tea => !WokonZwxw2
#trip => !hEpdoZ.tHU

You may also pipe a file to the program through stdin, first we create a test file

$ cat > test
a
tea
trip
$ cat test | trip
#a => !ZnBI2EKkq.
#tea => !WokonZwxw2
#trip => !hEpdoZ.tHU

You may also pipe the output from trip to another program like GNU/grep so that you may run tripcodes versus a wordlist.

$ cat /usr/share/dict/words | trip | grep -E '(ZnBI2EKkq.|WokonZwxw2|hEpdoZ.tHU)'
#a => !ZnBI2EKkq.
#tea => !WokonZwxw2
#trip => !hEpdoZ.tHU
